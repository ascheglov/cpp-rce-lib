Installation
============
This is header-only library,
so all that you need to do - is to add cpp-rce-lib directory to include directories:

Either locally for specific project:
	[Alt-F7] -> VC++ directories -> Include Directories
either globally for all projects:
	View -> Property Manager -> Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user -> VC++ directories -> Include Directories
